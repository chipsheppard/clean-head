This plugin disables relational links, WP version, wlwmanifest_link, shortlink, previous/next post links, and the new WordPress emoji functionality. GDPR friendly.


== Description ==

This plugin removed un-needed links in the header and disables the new WordPress emoji functionality. GDPR friendly.


Note: Emoticons will still work and emoji's will still work in browsers which have built in support for them. This plugin simply removes the extra code bloat used to add support for emoji's in older browsers.

= GDPR compliancy =

This plugin does not do anything to make your site less GDPR compliant. It disables the DNS prefetching of emoji's within WordPress, which should ensure improved privacy. To determine if your site is GDPR compliant, please seek legal advice. I have done my best to ensure the plugin is 100% GDPR compliant, but I am not a lawyer so can not guarantee anything ;)


== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'disable-emojis' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And yer done!
